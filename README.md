# kbmod
Based on LegacyKB and RandomKB with:
- New versions removed (1.9+)
- config removed (not needed because we aren't changing the kb a lot, its per season)
- added proper vert and hori friction (needed for extra configurablity)

Coming soon:
- Support for FrostPractice and Eden
- Maybe adding hooks for other practice cores like tropic practice
